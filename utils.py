        * Ensure pre-exercise hydration by consuming 6 ml of water per kilogram of body weight
        every 2-3 hours before exercise. For a 70kg individual, this equates to 420ml of fluid
        every 2-3 hours (a standard sports drink bottle contains 500ml).
        * Drink regularly throughout exercise. You should aim to drink enough to offset sweat
        losses, but it is important to avoid over-drinking because this can also have negative
        health effects. To familiarise yourself with how much you typically sweat, become
        accustomed to weighing yourself before and after practice or competition.
        * Where possible, select light-weight and breathable clothing with extra ventilation.
        * Remove unnecessary clothing/equipment and/or excess clothing layers.
        * Reduce the amount of skin that is covered by clothing – this will help increase your
        sweat evaporation, which will help you dissipate heat.

        sport (e.g. half-time) by ~10 minutes. This is effective for sports such as soccer/football and
        rugby and can be implemented across other sports such as field hockey.
        * Implement additional rest breaks that are not normally scheduled to occur. For example,
        3 to 5-min “quarter-time” breaks can be introduced mid-way through each half of a
        football or rugby match, or an extended 10-min drinks break can be introduced every
        hour of a cricket match or after the second set of a tennis match.
        * For sports with continuous play without any scheduled breaks, courses or play duration
        can be shortened

        * Water dousing – wetting your skin with cool water using a sponge or a spray bottle helps
        increase evaporation, which is the most effective cooling mechanism in the heat.
        * Ice packs/towels – placing an ice pack or damp towel filled with crushed ice around your
        neck.
